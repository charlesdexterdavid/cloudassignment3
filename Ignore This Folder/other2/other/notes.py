I suppose you can run pip through Python until this is sorted out. (https://docs.python.org/dev/installing/)

A quick googling seems to indicate that this is indeed a bug. Try this and report back:

python3.4 -m pip --version
python3.5 -m pip --version
If they report different versions then I guess you're good to go. Just run python3.5 -m pip install package instead of pip3 install package to install 3.5 packages.

They both show 1.5.4 but with the corresponding python version at the end in parentheses. Installing through the language works great, thank you. â€“ Radeon348 Feb 8 '16 at 2:45
